                <p>I graduated in Business Administration from the Federal Institute of Science and Technology of Minas
                    Gerais (2017) and I am currently pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development at Unicesumar
                    University in Maringá, PR. My first experience in the administrative field was as a hotel manager in
                    Rio Pomba, MG, where I worked for 2.5 years, developing management and leadership skills.

                    In addition, I have technical knowledge in computer assembly and maintenance. I am focused on
                    specializing in front-end programming and web development, areas that fascinate me for their
                    potential to create innovative and dynamic solutions.

                    I am proactive, organized, and creative, always eager to learn new things. My goal is to complete my
                    degree and work as a developer, combining passion and professional fulfillment.

                    In my free time, I enjoy immersing myself in games, movies, and series, which often inspire me to
                    think creatively and innovatively.
